On the surface, you’ve heard a couple of rules and thought, “yeah if I follow these rules, I’ll have 90% of what a great blogging platform has.” Reality is a little bit more complicated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a couple of longer blog posts up, and for some reason, they weren’t as legible as the average &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; article. Why aren’t they as legible? Why do people say they’re sort of hard to read? The font is sans-serif, it’s a fair size, and the lines aren’t too long. What exactly is wrong? Plenty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;serif-vs-sans-serif&quot;&gt;Serif vs. Sans-Serif&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the general rule for web content is to use sans-serif fonts, for most long-form websites, serif fonts are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand how, in my attempt to emulate &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, I missed that their body font was actually a &lt;strong&gt;serif font&lt;/strong&gt;. Same with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/&quot;&gt;Smashing Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/&quot;&gt;the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/&quot;&gt;the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically; for long-form pieces, stick to serif fonts; they look more “official” and serious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sans-serif fonts are still fine for titles, and short descriptions. Even rather short articles like you would see on CNN.com, or the descriptions of articles on the Washington Post are sans-serif.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dpi&quot;&gt;DPI&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason that sans-serif fonts have long been recommended for web content is that the DPI (dots per inch) for screens used to be way lower than print media, and it’s hard to see the little “feet” on serif fonts. Now, it still is lower, but screens have improved enough in recent years that DPI is no longer a concern when it comes to the serif or sans-serif decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;line-height&quot;&gt;Line Height&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, you’re fine with setting the line height around 1.5 (MS Word default) or 1.6 (Web recommendation). That’s all. Most other heights are far too sparse or way too dense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;characters-per-line&quot;&gt;Characters per Line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure the maximum number of characters per line is 85. Use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lettercount.com/&quot;&gt;a tool&lt;/a&gt; to count the characters (don’t count them yourself like I did). The ideal length is normally considered 45-75 characters for print, and up to 85 characters for web content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;font-size&quot;&gt;Font Size&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reading, the font size should be no less than 16pt. Medium.com uses 21pt, my website uses 20pt, and the New York Times uses 16pt for reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-golden-ratio&quot;&gt;The Golden Ratio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever settings you decided on, you’d probably want to know the ideal ratios between the three elements. Luckily we have the golden ratio to help us out. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pearsonified.com/typography/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a useful calculator to find the ideal ratios of the elements. I found that the golden ratio settings were extremely close to my own, (off by only a couple pixels) and I did a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of trial and error to be satisfied with my typography. Obviously, there are more concerns than typography on a webpage so you don’t have to follow the calculator to the pixel, but it’s a good reference guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-results&quot;&gt;The Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/combined.png&quot; alt=&quot;combined texts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the image in another tab and look at both carefully. You’ll see that while the original (left) is consistent and dense, the updated typography (right) is far easier to actually read. When I look at the two side by side, I was amazed that I even put up with the original. The updated typography is begging me to read it while the original was intimidating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, perfecting typography alone isn’t enough to make reading a delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;web-design&quot;&gt;Web Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest typography in the world won’t hide ugly, confusing, or distracting elements in your page. People have very short attention spans, and cultivating them is the most important part of any web page. When the user is reading, &lt;strong&gt;leave them alone&lt;/strong&gt;. Don’t have distracting sidebars or a huge top navbar. Look to Medium for example. The nav goes away while the user is reading. Most reading-focused websites have extremely sparse elements once the user starts reading. The text should be the focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stick with white backgrounds and black/dark gray text; it’s high contrast and easy to read. Colored text is only to be used as highlights or for links: it’s fairly difficult to make it look professional looking as body text. Colored backgrounds tend not to work unless they’re fairly subtle: you don’t want the &lt;em&gt;background&lt;/em&gt; of the text to be the focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These aren’t concrete rules, but if you know enough to deviate from them (hint: you don’t); you’re probably not getting much out of this post anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Design is a lot harder than it looks; don’t brush it aside and only pay attention to a couple rules you heard once. Great, functional design will keep people engaged, and that is the entire point of blogging or writing. Content is important, but what the content looks like is equally important. Not many people will read a 10pt Times New Roman wall of text, no matter how amazing the information inside is. If you want people to get your message, don’t make it unnecessarily  difficult! The internet is a battleground for attention, and if your content doesn’t have the best armor, it’s getting killed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Building a beautiful reading experience is a lot harder than it looks.

Many developers including myself find static site generators to be incredibly convenient and powerful tools; this very blog was made with a static site generator. Why exactly is this a trend? Let’s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynamic-vs-static-websites&quot;&gt;Dynamic vs. Static Websites&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most websites with interactive or user added content (like comments or posts) have a server (with an appropriate OS), database, backend routing, plugins and more. Furthermore when there is a CMS (Content Management System: Wordpress, Drupal) involved (as it typically is for clients) then there’s CMS specific themes, plugins, and the CMS application itself. Now &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is a ton of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statically generated websites have none of that; they’re just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files generated and hosted on a server. This confers significant advantages, while not having as much of a disadvantage in features as you may think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ease-of-development&quot;&gt;Ease of Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static site generators are very easy to create and deploy. All I did to create this blog was fork a repository called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now&quot;&gt;Jekyll Now&lt;/a&gt; and edit the configuration file. Github automatically generates and deploys your Jekyll website. From that point, all you have to do is add blog posts in markdown. Obviously, if you want a custom theme, it will take some work, but getting the website itself up and running is no issue at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is perfect if you, like me, don’t want to spend too much time on the design and coding of a blog or website; rather focusing on the content while working on other projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lightweight&quot;&gt;Lightweight&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statically generated websites are much faster than dynamic websites. Heavy duty backends that are present on most websites really slow everything down and add a lot of bloat to the server. Static websites eliminate almost all of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This way you can have a website that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Loads faster&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Takes less server space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which in turn allows you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep users engaged&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save money on servers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be better prepared for traffic spikes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speed is a critical measure for websites; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/&quot;&gt;53% of mobile users abandon a website that takes longer than 3 seconds to load.&lt;/a&gt; Too many businesses, big and small, have bloated web pages that take far too long to load causing users to become bored and frustrated. If you want users to pay attention, you can’t be wasting their time loading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-adds-up/&quot;&gt;You can use this calculator to see what effect your slower page speeds are having.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.pexels.com/photos/17840/pexels-photo.jpg?w=1260&amp;amp;h=750&amp;amp;dpr=2&amp;amp;auto=compress&amp;amp;cs=tinysrgb&quot; alt=&quot;Server Strain&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-are-static-websites-faster&quot;&gt;Why are Static Websites Faster?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static websites improve speed and alleviate servers because they are so incredibly small causing the strain per “serve” to a user to be reduced. Also, static websites have fewer files, in general, causing it to have a faster load as well: 5000 files together taking up 1 GB of space take more time to download than one large file that takes up 1 GB of space. The reason for this is because the server and your computer have to make a sort of “handshake” for every individual file slowing down the entire process. Backend frameworks tend to have a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of files, especially in heavyweight or slower frameworks like Ruby on Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;simplified&lt;/strong&gt; way to think about this: the reduced space in conjunction with fewer files allows the server to spend a ton fewer resources: less CPU strain because of less file processing, and less RAM usage because the file size for the concurrently running websites is smaller. For example, using a static website generator means that 1 GB of RAM can run maybe 500 of your websites vs 50 with a typical dynamic site and the CPU isn’t straining to make a billion handshakes because all it has to do is load 5-10 files instead of 50-100. So you can have 10 times the users with the same server space, and those users will receive their content much faster because the CPU on the server isn’t strained at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CMSs are both finicky and vulnerable. Avoiding them will prevent common exploits from affecting your website. It’s been estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wpwhitesecurity.com/wordpress-security-news-updates/statistics-70-percent-wordpress-installations-vulnerable/&quot;&gt;almost 70% of Wordpress websites are vulnerable to very common exploits and hacks&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t a thing that is easily mitigated either: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/07/panama_papers_unpatched_wordpress_drupal/&quot;&gt;even the most powerful people in the world are vulnerable to this.&lt;/a&gt; This is the nature of having a visible backend or CMS; people can easily identify and exploit it.  With a static website, you get around this because you often don’t even &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; a backend to exploit. Even if you do have a very simple backend, hackers won’t be able to know which backend framework or language you’re using which makes the entire process much more difficult for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.pexels.com/photos/414579/pexels-photo-414579.jpeg?w=1260&amp;amp;h=750&amp;amp;dpr=2&amp;amp;auto=compress&amp;amp;cs=tinysrgb&quot; alt=&quot;Moving Parts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reliability&quot;&gt;Reliability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most fundamental ideas when it comes to engineering a physical product is that less moving parts result in greater reliability. This is also true for websites. Even if your website works perfectly now, over time something will go wrong. This happens whenever there is a server and complex backend involved. There is sort of this code “rot” that happens for a myriad of unidentifiable reasons and your perfectly running website will go down if not maintained. Having a statically generated website means that there are almost no “moving parts”, and the website can stay online for years without much maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features-parity&quot;&gt;Features Parity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest disadvantages of static websites is their lack of features and interactivity. Dynamic websites have no problem making users interact and post things on the website. This isn’t as big of a problem as you may think though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the major static site generators are slowly adding many of the most common features of fully fledged websites. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://staticman.net/&quot;&gt;plugin that allows for comments to be posted&lt;/a&gt;, (or you could use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://disqus.com/&quot;&gt;service like Disqus&lt;/a&gt;). When it comes to forms, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/&quot;&gt;Netlify has a form handler&lt;/a&gt;. Can’t search on a static website? Oh wait &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.algolia.com/&quot;&gt;you can&lt;/a&gt; Do you want your clients to have a nice CMS interface? There are ways of hooking up the generator with a CMS and generating a new post upon clicking submit in the CMS. You can even &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/masukomi/JekyllMail&quot;&gt;email in posts&lt;/a&gt;. As you can see, if you want a feature in a static website, there is probably already someone working on it and it will just get better and better over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-control-github&quot;&gt;Version Control: GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Jekyll to run this blog, and I chose it specifically for its integration with Github pages. Absolutely free server and domain? Automatic generation upon push? Github as version control? Sign me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage of version control is that you can take a look at the edits you’ve made to your blog, from the grammar edits to the spellings, and even better, if someone else finds an issue, they can make a request to fix it in GitHub. It’s like your readers are working together with you on an open source project to make the best blog possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than that, there are backups to all changes, so you can easily revert to an earlier stage if something goes wrong. Constantly backing up databases is a much clumsier alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s clear from what I’ve written, I like static site generators. In descending order, I like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cheap and Lightweight on Servers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Secure&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convenient to Use&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Version Control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Near Feature Parity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that most businesses can move towards a static website with no real ill effects. Most major features can be outsourced to another website or plugin that handles it. Statically generated websites are good enough for heavy duty things like &lt;a href=&quot;http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/&quot;&gt;the Obama campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://services.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Services&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/&quot;&gt;the Ruby on Rails blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://developmentseed.org/blog/new-healthcare-gov-is-open-and-cms-free/&quot;&gt;the new Healthcare.gov&lt;/a&gt;, (&lt;a href=&quot;http://planetjekyll.github.io/showcase/&quot;&gt;and more!&lt;/a&gt;) and they’re convenient enough for small blogs like this one to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static website generators are the future, and we should be happy about it; who doesn’t want a faster and lighter-weight web experience?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Static Website Generators are an increasingly popular tool for web development.

The &lt;a href=&quot;http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup&quot;&gt;original notes&lt;/a&gt; are legendarily meticulous, and the book is itself a curated and refactored collection of those notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;peter-theil&quot;&gt;Peter Theil&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Theil is a fascinating figure; a contrarian, “the bad boy of Silicon Valley”, “the philosopher VC”, Theil has quite the notoriety. From supporting Donald Trump to the lawsuit against Gawker media, Theil has earned the ire of most of left-leaning Silicon Valley. Despite all of this, Theil has remained something of a cult figure, especially among the more conservative minded. I wasn’t all too sympathetic towards Theil and his views but after reading this book I am approaching my attitudes towards him from an entirely different angle. While I still don’t agree with much of what he says, he clearly knows a thing or two about entrepreneurship and start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is not a step by step guide for creating a start-up when compared to titles such as “the Lean Startup” or “the Startup Owners Manual”, but it is a unique view into the minds of one of Silicon Valley’s most intriguing people. I’ll discuss the most insightful and in-depth chapters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;party-like-its-1999&quot;&gt;Party Like It’s 1999&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Nasdaq_Composite_dot-com_bubble.svg/500px-Nasdaq_Composite_dot-com_bubble.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;dotcom bubble&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter Theil along with Elon Musk and “the PayPal mafia” sold their company PayPal right before the 2001 dot-com bust. Going from maniac exuberance back to reality caused the companies of the time to learn a few lessons about business and technology. They were to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make Incremental Advances&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay Lean and Flexible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve on the competition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focus on product, not sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theil argues that all of these ideas are mistaken, and will just lead to mediocrity. I personally was on board with those suggestions until Theil made his argument for an alternative and contrarian version of the list which he contends will lead a company to much greater success. Theil claims:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is better to risk boldness than triviality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bad plan is better than no plan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Competitive markets destroy profits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sales matters just as much as product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a friend about this and he seemed to be skeptical of most of these points. Perhaps a really bad plan can be worse than no plan. Competition breeds improvement. If you don’t focus on your product you won’t get sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To these I’d probably say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s rare to be able to plan &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; badly that no plan is superior. A plan would at the very least improve your business and move it in a particular direction whereas no plan would improve you nowhere in particular. It’s not the difference between a specialist and generalist, it’s more like the difference between having goals and messing around.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A competitive market is good for consumers in that you get the cheapest prices, but R&amp;amp;D cannot be done without profits. Improvements can’t be made without investment. Ultimately you want companies to spend a lot on R&amp;amp;D so that you can have better products over time, not just the cheapest products right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You need both sales and product but some people will buy a bad product if the sales strategy is great. If you have the greatest product in the world but nobody knows about it, it’s irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say however that these two lists aren’t mutually exclusive, all of the points must be judged by the specific context in which they take place. Some companies really have a bad product and great sales, so they should actually focus on product. Some companies are too rigid and overly planned, not responding to consumer demand and market changes. Any list that claims to have the be all, end all truth is wrongheaded at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to find your place within these dichotomies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Incrementalism vs. Boldness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leanness vs. Planning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Competition vs. Monopolization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product vs. Sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;you-are-not-a-lottery-ticket&quot;&gt;You Are Not a Lottery Ticket&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Lottery_ticket_-_Queen%27s_College_Lottery%2C_New-Brunswick%2C_New_Jersey%2C_USA%2C_1814.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lottery ticket&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theil starts the chapter criticizing the hyper-successful who ascribe their considerable wealth and success to pure luck or being in the right place at the right time. He notably brings up the fact that there are people who have created multiple &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt; - dollar companies which seems to fly in the face of the idea that every huge company is a lucky one hit wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most entrepreneurs seem to reject this framing. Almost every guest on podcasts such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this&quot;&gt;“How I Built This”&lt;/a&gt; say that their success is mostly luck based and being in the right place at the right time. The book quotes Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and the like talking about their abundant luck. Theil thinks that this is a sort of strategic modesty. I think it’s not only that, but also that people may not realize how &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; they really are. Oftentimes when narrating their journey, great entrepreneurs seem to get into situations which a normal person wouldn’t, or take risks that a normal person wouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, they all seem to work inhumanly hard and are extremely intelligent. Michael Dell talked about making hundreds of thousands in sales out of a dorm room basically, but unlike a typical college student who would be incredibly satisfied with that, he continued pushing and trying to compete with bigger and bigger companies. Can you imagine many undergrads deciding to work &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; after casually getting $600,000 in sales from their dorm room business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Koch of Samuel Adams quit his lucrative consulting job at BCG to start a company in a seemingly dead industry. American beer went from being a joke to probably the best in the world when it comes to craft beer. The founders of Airbnb created hugely successful presidential election cereal on a whim. These aren’t the actions or achievements of normal people. Obviously, the market conditions and lifestyles of all these entrepreneurs was perfect for what they wanted to do, but that’s discounting their own very real talent of being able to take advantage of those opportunities at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving past the discussion of luck, the book takes a philosophical turn into a discussion of free will and our loci of control. Theil argues that instead of thinking of yourself as a lottery ticket and just hoping that you are the one in a million who will create something transcendent, you actually have to believe it and go try to make it happen. Far too often people are fatalistic when it comes to their own success; they hear Bill Gates say that he was just lucky, and they hope they get lucky too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached a similar conclusion on my own; whether or not we &lt;strong&gt;ultimately&lt;/strong&gt; live in a predetermined universe is irrelevant; &lt;em&gt;acting&lt;/em&gt; as if you don’t will make you much more successful in your endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-enlightenment-2-0/daniel-dennett&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Daniel_dennett_Oct2008.JPG/1280px-Daniel_dennett_Oct2008.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;dan dennett&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The philosopher Daniel Dennett brought this up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/beyond-belief-enlightenment-2-0/daniel-dennett&quot;&gt;one of his talks (5:30)&lt;/a&gt;: which would you prefer to have as an army (assuming equal training and equipment); 1000 fundamentalists who are willing to die for this battle, or 1000 economists looking over their life insurance policies? Even if the economists have a more accurate worldview, they still wouldn’t be as successful as the fundamentalists. Dan goes on further to say that the fundamentalists pay the hidden cost of dishonesty, but we don’t have to in our case, we can accept our evidence backed (or not!) beliefs of reality while living life a different way. Effectively we can have our cake and eat it too. This hints at a more complicated problem, however; how do you know if you are the lone genius or the lone lunatic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that ultimately you can’t know. A true lunatic will never know that they are a lunatic, and this is why it will always be safer not to go down the uncharted road. However, if nobody ever took such a risk where would we be? Even if you don’t ultimately believe it, living your life as if you have 100% control over &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; that happens, and you’ll make a much bigger impact on your circumstances than you may think. Just think about it: being screwed over by a person who has power over you may be something that seemed completely out of your control, but if you live your life as if you &lt;em&gt;could’ve&lt;/em&gt; prevented it, then in the future you’ll be able to identify the superiors who would do you harm, and find a way to lessen or neutralize their influence over you. Making an effort in that direction, where there was none before can have incredibly positive impacts that you never would’ve known had you just given up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;optimism-vs-pessimism-and-planning-vs-hope&quot;&gt;Optimism vs. Pessimism and Planning vs. Hope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4c8ybPUgN1qbb0b4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Optimist &amp;amp; Pessimist Chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same chapter, an interesting concept introduced by Theil was the idea of the 4 quadrants of definite optimism, indefinite optimism, definite pessimism, and indefinite pessimism. This was a very stars and stripesy section but it brought up some interesting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indefinite-optimism&quot;&gt;Indefinite Optimism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theil writes that the USA is currently in an indefinite optimistic mindset: we believe the world will be better in the future, we just don’t know how. We aren’t going to make specific steps towards it either; we’ll just sit and watch. There’s a cycle of finance in this indefinitely optimistic country which goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4c93dx1EQ1qbb0b4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Finance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is really happening. It’s just a self-sustaining cycle where nobody is brave enough to make an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; investment in anything or anyone. We just live with the assumption that &lt;em&gt;someone else will do it&lt;/em&gt;. People hold onto government bonds and savings even while they have a lower or equal expected return than the inflation rate. People are allowing their money to slowly rot away rather than actually investing it in anything. This seems absurd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the “innovative” companies like Google and Apple are just sitting on piles of cash in offshore accounts, and letting them rot. They’re too scared to put that money into an actual venture and are content with just losing it slowly. The United States at this moment seems to be a bunch of risk managers, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indefinite-pessimism&quot;&gt;Indefinite Pessimism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe, on the other hand, is pessimistic about the future; it’s in decline, but won’t take any definitive steps to stop it. Once again, they’ll just sit and watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;definite-pessimism&quot;&gt;Definite Pessimism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China, Theil argues, is a pessimistic society but with defined plans. They know they can copy the Western model to great success and will continuously copy until they catch up. Theil writes “Every other country is afraid that China is going to take over the world; China is the only country afraid that it won’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting is Japan’s place in this. Theil said that Japan used to occupy this position; they relentlessly copied the United States in every facet. Japan took denim, technology, manufacturing from the USA and the West. Now, however, Japan seems completely uninterested in the USA. Japanese denim is the best in the world. Japanese technology is very different than American, same with cars, programming, and television. Golf used to be hugely popular in the 80s in Japan, now the golf courses are being turned into solar farms. Theil thinks that this is a disturbing sign of the stagnation of the West. We used to think that it was OK for Japan to copy us because while they were busy copying, we’d be moving on to the next thing. Now, however, they’ve caught up, and they’ve found nothing more that we provide. The Western world is no longer far ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.pexels.com/photos/60132/pexels-photo-60132.jpeg?w=1260&amp;amp;h=750&amp;amp;dpr=2&amp;amp;auto=compress&amp;amp;cs=tinysrgb&quot; alt=&quot;SpaceX&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;definite-optimism&quot;&gt;Definite Optimism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theil reminisces for the USA of the 50s and 60s. John F. Kennedy said that we would reach the moon in 10 years, and we did it. People made huge, ambitious, audacious plans and then went out and tried to complete them. Nowadays we’ll have experts saying that everything is impossible or infeasible. The thing is; the experts are right 99% of the time; that’s why they’re experts. This is the problem with our society though; if we only do the feasible we’ll never do anything truly great or amazing. Greatness comes from doing what’s unthinkable, not what we say “yeah we should do that next” to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theil wants us to forget finance and focus on engineering. Forget savings and focus on investment. The greatest companies are built by great engineers and sales people (more on this in the next section) not CFOs and accountants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;if-you-build-it-will-they-come&quot;&gt;If You Build It, Will They Come?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://images.pexels.com/photos/190574/pexels-photo-190574.jpeg?w=1260&amp;amp;h=750&amp;amp;dpr=2&amp;amp;auto=compress&amp;amp;cs=tinysrgb&quot; alt=&quot;engine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineers have always seemed to have the upper hand in the “who is more useful” debate. After all, what’s a sales person with nothing to sell? This chapter really dives into the false security engineers have in “product” over everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line is; a  product that sells itself is a fantasy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a lesson for a lot of professionals. The lawyer that gets paid the most in the firm isn’t the best lawyer in the courthouse; he’s the rainmaker out there getting clients for the firm. The richest businessmen aren’t the CTOs, they’re the CEOs. The most powerful political actors aren’t &lt;em&gt;policy&lt;/em&gt; geniuses, they’re &lt;em&gt;political&lt;/em&gt; geniuses. In order to do anything; the “engineering” is expected, the sales is where the greatness comes in. Nikola Tesla was probably a much better engineer and inventor than Thomas Edison, yet he’s not nearly as well known (before Elon Musk’s &lt;em&gt;Tesla&lt;/em&gt; that is), and he wasn’t remembered like Edison was. This is the prototypical case of the pure engineer against the 1/2 engineer, 1/2 salesman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much more to get into with this book, from the similarities between the Unabomber and hipsters to secrets and philosophy. Perhaps I’ll get into it in another blog post. What I’ve written above however are what I found to be the most seminal points. This wasn’t a start-up manual, it was a historical and philosophical look into the mind of one of Silicon Valley’s most interesting people. The breadth of topics covered was as wide as the perspectives unique. I suggest you give it a read.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Zero to One - Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future is a book based on the lectures of Peter Theil and the notes of Blake Masters.
