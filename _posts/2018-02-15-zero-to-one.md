***Zero to One*** - *Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future* is a book based on the lectures of Peter Theil and the notes of Blake Masters. The [original notes](http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup) are almost legendarily meticulous, and the book is a curated collection of those notes.  

# Peter Theil

Peter Theil is a fascinating figure in Silicon Valley. A contrarian, "the bad boy of Silicon Valley", "the philosopher VC", Theil has quite the notoriety. From supporting Donald Trump to the lawsuit against Gawker media, Theil has earned the ire of most of left-leaning Silicon Valley. Despite all of this, Theil has remained something of a cult figure, especially among the more conservative minded. I wasn't all too sympathetic towards Theil and his views but after reading this book I am approaching my attitudes towards him from an entirely different perspective. While I still don't agree with much of what he says and does, he clearly knows a thing or two about entrepreneurship. 

This book may not be the best guide for creating a start-up when compared to titles such as "the Lean Startup" or "the Startup Owners Manual", but it is a unique view into the minds of one of Silicon Valley's most intriguing people. I'll discuss what were the most interesting and in-depth chapters to me. 

## Party Like It's 1999

Peter Theil along with Elon Musk and "the PayPal mafia" sold their company PayPal right before the 2001 dot-com bust. Going from maniac exuberance back to reality caused the start-ups of the time to learn a few lessons about business and technology. They were: 

1. Make Incremental Advances
2. Stay Lean and Flexible
3. Improve on the competition
4. Focus on product, not sales

Theil argues that all of these are mistaken, and will just lead to mediocrity. I personally was on board with those suggestions until Theil made his argument an alternative contrarian version of the list which he contends will lead a company to much greater success. Theil claims: 

1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality
2. A bad plan is better than no plan
3. Competitive markets destroy profits
4. Sales matters just as much as product

I was talking to a friend about this and he seemed to be skeptical of most of these points. I would say that although these two lists are mutually exclusive, all of the points must be judged by the specific context in which they take place. I can definitely think of a few companies that should have adapted their plans more readily, or focused more on product. 

You have to find your place within these dichotomies: 

***Incrementalism vs Boldness***

***Leanness vs Planning***

***Competition vs Monopolization***

***Product vs Sales***

# You Are Not a Lottery Ticket 

Theil starts the chapter criticizing the hyper-successful who ascribe their considerable wealth and success to pure luck or being in the right place at the right time. He notably brings up the fact that there are people who have created multiple *billion* - dollar companies which seems to fly in the face of the idea that every huge company is a lucky one hit wonder. 

Most entrepreneurs seem to reject this framing. Almost every guest on podcasts such as ["How I Built This"](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this) say that their success is mostly luck based and being in the right place at the right time. The book quotes Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and the like saying talking about their abundant luck. Theil thinks that this is a sort of strategic modesty. I think it's not only that, but also that people may not realize how *weird* they really are. Oftentimes when narrating their journey, entrepreneurs always seem to get into situations which a normal person wouldn't, or take risks that a normal person wouldn't. In addition to that, they all seem to work inhumanly hard and are extremely intelligent. Michael Dell talked about making hundreds of thousands in sales out of a dorm room basically, but unlike a typical college student who would be incredibly satisfied with that, he continued pushing and trying to compete with bigger and bigger companies. Can you imagine many undergrads deciding to work *harder* after casually getting $600,000 in sales from their dorm room business? Jim Koch of Samuel Adams quit his lucrative consulting job at BCG to start a company in a seemingly dead industry. American beer went from being a joke to probably the best in the world when it comes to craft beer. The founders of Airbnb created hugely successful presidential election cereal on a whim. These aren't the actions or achievements of normal people. Obviously, the market conditions and lifestyles of all these entrepreneurs was perfect for what they wanted to do, but that's discounting their own very real talent of being able to take advantage of those opportunities at all. 

Moving past the discussion of luck, the book takes a philosophical turn into a discussion of free will and our loci of control. Theil argues that thinking of yourself as a lottery ticket and just hoping that you are the one in a million who will create something transcendent, you actually have to believe it and go try to make it happen. Often people are fatalist when it comes to their own success. They hear Bill Gates say that he was just lucky, and they hope they get lucky too. 

 I reached a similar conclusion to on my own; whether or not we **ultimately** live in a predetermined universe is irrelevant; *acting* that you don't will make you much more successful in your endeavors. 
 
 The philosopher Daniel Dennett brought this up in one of his talks: which would you prefer to have as an army; 1000 fundamentalists who are willing to die for this battle, or 1000 economists looking over their life insurance policies? Even if the economists have a more accurate worldview, they still wouldn't be as successful as the fundamentalists. This hints at a more complicated problem, however; how do you know if you are the lone genius or the lone lunatic? 

 I think that ultimately you can't know. A true lunatic will never know that they are a lunatic, and this is why it will always be safer to not go down the uncharted road. However, if nobody ever took a risk where would we be? Even if you don't ultimately believe it, living your life as if you have 100% control over **everything** that happens, and you'll make a much bigger impact on your circumstances than you may think. Being screwed over by a person who has power over you may be something that seemed completely out of your control, but if you live your life as if you *could've* prevented it, then in the future you'll be able to identify the superiors who would do you harm, and find a way to lessen or neutralize their influence over you. 

## Optimism vs. Pessimism and Planning vs. Hope

![Optimist & Pessimist Chart](http://78.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4c8ybPUgN1qbb0b4.png)

In the same chapter, an interesting concept introduced by Theil was the idea of the 4 quadrants of definite optimism, indefinite optimism, definite pessimism, and indefinite pessimism. This was a very stars and stripesy section but it brought up some interesting ideas. 

### Indefinite Optimism

Theil writes that the USA is currently in an indefinite optimist mindset: we believe the world will be better in the future, we just don't know how. We aren't going to make specific steps towards it either. 

### Indefinite Pessimism 

Europe, on the other hand, is pessimistic about the future; it's in decline, but won't take any definitive steps to stop it. 

### Definite Pessimism 

China, Theil argues, is a pessimistic society but with defined plans. They know they can copy the Western model to great success and will continuously copy until they catch up. Theil writes "Every other country is afraid that China is going to take over the world; China is the only country afraid that it won't." 

What's interesting about this is the place Japan has occupied in this. This wasn't discussed in the book but in a talk given later. Theil said that Japan used to occupy this position; they relentlessly copied the United States in every facet. Japan took denim, technology, manufacturing from the USA and the West. Now, however, Japan seems completely uninterested in the USA. Japanese denim is the best in the world. Japanese technology is very different than American, same with cars, programming, and television. Golf used to be widely popular in the 80s in Japan, now the courses are being turned into solar farms. Theil thinks that this is a somewhat disturbing sign of the stagnation of the West. We used to think that it was alright for Japan to copy us because while they were busy copying, we'd be moving on to the next thing. Now, however, they've caught up and found nothing more that we provide. The Western world is no longer far ahead of anyone. 

### Definite Optimism

Theil reminisces for the USA of the 50s and 60s. John F. Kennedy said that we would reach the moon in 10 years, and we did it. People made huge, ambitious, audacious plans and then went out and tried to complete them. Nowadays we'll have experts saying that everything is impossible or infeasible. The thing is; the experts are right 99% of the time; that's why they're experts. This is the problem with our society though, if we only do the feasible we'll never do anything truly great or amazing. Greatness comes from doing what's unthinkable, not what we say "yeah we should do that next" to. 

# If You Build It, Will They Come? 

Engineers have always seemed to have the upper hand in the "who is more useful" debate. After all, what's a sales person with nothing to sell? This chapter really dives into the false security engineers have in "product" over everything. 

**The bottom line is; a  product that sells itself is a fantasy.**

This is definitely a lesson for a lot of professionals. The lawyer that gets paid the most in the firm isn't the best lawyer in the courthouse; he's the rainmaker out there getting clients for the firm. The richest businessmen aren't the CTOs, they're the CEOs. The most powerful political actors aren't *policy* geniuses, they're *political* geniuses. In order to do anything; the "engineering" is expected, the sales is where the greatness comes in. Nikola Tesla was probably a much better engineer and inventor than Thomas Edison, yet he's not nearly as well known (before Elon Musk's *Tesla* that is), and he didn't make his mark on the world like Edison did. This is the prime example of the pure engineer against the engineer + salesman. 

## Conclusion

There is much more to get into with this book, from the similarities between the Unabomber and hipsters to secrets and philosophy. What I've written above are what I found to be the most seminal points. This wasn't a start-up manual, it was a historical and philosophical look into the mind of one of Silicon Valley's most interesting people. I suggest you give it a read.
