I am a relatively new programmer, only having begun in December 2017, and I have to say it feels like I have entered into a completely different world. 

I was a somewhat aimless business major who didn't really know what he wanted to do. Changing my goals at every whim, and not really having my life together lead to a case of depression. Every day was an aimless momvement through life, just doing the bare minimum to stay on track; not really working toward anything. 

This was all until a friend approached me with the idea of building a political survey. I am a pretty avid follower of policy building, and the idea of contributing something however small to one of my interests was intriguing. He is a computer science student so the agreement was that I would do all the research on policy questions, and he would do the website building. What ended up happenning was me getting a policy matrix done extremely quickly, and him still struggling with HTML. At that point I thought that I could get the HTML and front-end together, however crappy, while he learned that to take over in the future. What ended up happenning was me falling in love with the entire process. 

I started out with a pretty long form, with really ugly backgrounds and text, and slowly progressed to making websites with bootstrap.
