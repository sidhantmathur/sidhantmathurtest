***Zero to One*** - *Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future* is a book based on the lectures of Peter Theil and the notes of Blake Masters. The [original notes](http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup) are almost legendary among certain groups, and the book is a curated collection of those notes.  

### Peter Theil

Peter Theil is one of the most fascinating figures in Silicon Valley. A contraian, "the bad boy of Silicon Valley", "the philospoher VC", Theil has quite the noteriety. From suporting Donald Trump, and his battle against Gawker media, Theil has earned the ire of most of left-leaning Silicon Valley. Despite all of this, Theil has remained something of a cult figure, especially among the more conservative minded. I wasn't all too sympathetic towards Theil and his views but after reading this book I am approaching my attitudes towards him from an entirely different perspective. While I still don't agree with much of what he says and does, he clearly knows a thing or two about entrepreneurship. 

This book may not be the best guide for creating a start-up when compared to titles such as "the Lean Startup" or "the Startup Owners Manual", but it is a unique view into the minds of one of Silicon Valley's most intriguing people. I'll discuss what were the most interesting and in-depth chapters to me. 

### Party Like It's 1999

Peter Theil along with Elon Musk and "the PayPal mafia" sold their company PayPal right before the 2001 dot-com bust. Going from maniac exuberance back to reality caused the businesses of the time to learn a few important lessons about business. They were: 

1. Make Incremental Advances
2. Stay Lean and Flexible
3. Improve on the competition
4. Focus on product, not sales

Theil argues that all of these are mistaken, and will just lead to mediocrity. I personally was on board with those suggestions until Theil made his arguement an alternative contrarian version of the list which he contends will lead a company to much greater success. Theil claims: 

1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality
2. A bad plan is better than no plan
3. Competitive markets destroy profits
4. Sales matters just as much as product

I was talking to a friend about these points and he seemed to be skeptical of most of these points. I would say that these two lists can both be right for different types of companies or entreprenuers. If you're a person who's looking to just create a nice little business so that you can make a quick buck, the first list might work in a locality (excluding #4). If you're a person looking to create a paradigm shift, be everywhere, and go from "Zero to One" then Theil's list would be the better option. 

#### Incrementalism vs Boldnesss
#### Leanness vs Planning
#### Competition vs Monopolization
#### Product vs Sales + Product

### You Are Not a Lottery Ticket 

Theil starts the chapter criticizing all the hyper-successful people who ascribe their considerable wealth and success to pure luck, or being in the right place at the right time. He noteably brings up the fact that there are people who have created multiple *billion* - dollar companies which seems to fly in the face of the idea that every company is a one hit wonder. Many entrepreneurs seem to disagree with this framing though. Almost every guest on podcasts such as "How I Build This" say that their success is mostly luck based and being in the right place at the right time. Theil thinks that this is a sort of strategic modesty which I think plays a part, but oftentimes people may not realize how *weird* they really are. Oftentimes when narrating their journey, entrepreneurs always seem to get into situations which a normal person wouldn't, or take risks that they wouldn't. In addition to that, they all seem to work inhumanly hard, and are extremly intelligent. Michael Dell talked about making hundreds of thousands in sales out of a dormroom basically, but unlike a typical college student who would be incredibly satisfied with that, he continued pushing and trying to compete with bigger and bigger companies. Jim Koch of Samuel Adams quit his lucrative consulting job at BCG to start a company in a seemingly dead product marketplace. These aren't the actions of normal people. Obviously the market conditions and lifestyles of all these entrepreneurs was perfect for what they wanted to do, but that's discounting their own very real talent of being able to take advantage of those opportunities at all. 

Moving past the discussion of luck, the book discusses free will and our loci of control. Theil argues that thinking of yourself as a lottery ticket and just hoping that you are the one in a million who will create something transcendent, you actually have to believe it and go try to make it happen. I reached a similar conclusion to on my own; whether or not we **ultimately** live in a predetermined universe is irrelevant; believing that you don't will make you much more successful in your endeavours. The philospoher Daniel Dennett brought this up in one of his talks: which would you prefer to have as an army; 1000 fundementalists who are willing to die for this battle, or 1000 economists looking over their life insurance policies? Even if you don't ultimately believe it, living your life as if you have 100% control over **everything** that happens, and you'll make a much bigger impact on your circumstances than you may think. 

Futhermore, a very fascinating concept introduced by Theil was the idea of the 4 quadrants of definite optimism indefinite optimism, definite pessimism and indefinite pessimism. This was a very stars and stripesy section but it brought up some interesting ideas. 

### If You Build It, Will They Come? 

Engineers have always seemed to have the upper hand in the "who is more useful" debate. After all, what is a sales person to do with nothing to sell? This chapter really dives into the false security engineers have in product over everything. A product that sells itself is a fantasy. I have always felt like both skillsets were critically important and I have incorporated both into my education. I learned about art taking classes during middle school,business and sales in college, and web development on my own the past few months. Obviously my skills in all of the above are not as good as they could be.
