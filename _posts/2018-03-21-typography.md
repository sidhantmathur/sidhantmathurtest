Building a beautiful reading experience is a lot harder than it looks. On the surface you've heard a couple of rules and thought, "yeah if I follow these rules, I'll have 90% of what a great blogging platform has." Reality is a little bit more complicated: I had a couple of longer blog posts up, and for some reason, they weren't as easily readable as the average [Medium](https://medium.com/) article. 

Why aren't they as legible? The font is Sans-Serif, it's a fair size, and the lines aren't too long. What exactly is wrong? Plenty. 

## Serif vs. Sans-Serif

While the general rule for web content is to use sans-serif fonts, for most long-form websites, serif fonts are used. 

I don't understand how, in my attempt to emulate [Medium](https://medium.com/), I missed that their body font was actually a **serif font**. Same with [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/), [the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/), and [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/). 

Bascially; for long-form pieces, stick to serif fonts; they look more "official" and serious. 

Sans-serif fonts are still fine for titles, and short descriptions. Even rather short articles like you would see on CNN.com, or the descriptions of articles on the Washington Post are sans-serif. 

### DPI

The reason that sans-serif fonts have long been reccommended for web content is that the DPI (dots per inch) for screens used to be way lower than print media, and it's hard to see the little "feet" on serif fonts. Now, it still is lower, but screens have improved enough in recent years that DPI is no longer a concern when it comes to the serif or sans-serif decision. 

## Line Height

Set the line height around 1.5 (MS Word default) or 1.6 (Web reccomendation). That's all. Most others are way too sparse or way too dense. 

## Line Length

Make sure the maxiumum number of characters per line is 85. Use [a tool](https://www.lettercount.com/) to count the characters (don't count them yourself like I did). The ideal length is normally considered 45-75 characters for print, and up to  85 characters for web content.  

## Font Size

For reading, the font size should be no less than 16pt. Medium.com uses 21pt, my website uses 20pt, and the New York Times uses 16pt for refrence. 

## Web Design

The greatest typography in the world won't hide ugly, confusing, or distracting elements in your page. People have very short attention spans, and cultivating them is the most important part of any web page. When the user is reading, **leave them alone**. Don't have distracting sidebars, or a huge top navbar. Look to Medium for example. The nav goes away while the user is reading. Most reading focused websites have extremly sparse elements once the user starts reading. The text should be the focus. 

## Content

Don't be boring.

## Conclusion

Design is a lot harder than it looks; don't brush it aside with a couple rules you heard once. Great, functional design will keep people engaged, and that is the entire point of blogging or writing. Content is important; but what the content looks like is equally important. Not many people will read a 12pt Times New Roman article, no matter how amazing the information inside is.
